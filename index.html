                           <p> Accountants and bookkeepers do very different things for the companies they work for. Bookkeepers are responsible for the ongoing maintenance of their clients' general ledgers, such as compiling data on a daily basis, categorizing expenses in the general ledger, reviewing the general ledger for accuracy, reconciling bank statements, and generating financial statements, but accountants use the bookkeeper's accurate and up-to-date general ledger to provide advisory services such as analyzing the company's financial data and preparing income tax returns as well as tax planning advice.</p>
