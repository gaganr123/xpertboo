              <p>
                Like many web-based service providers, Bench (Bench Accounting,
                Inc. and its affiliates, collectively “Bench”) utilizes
                “cookies” in connection with the use of our “Services”. This
                cookie notice provides information about how and when we use
                cookies and other similar tracking technologies on our platform
                and our website (collectively, our “Services”). To better
                understand how we use the data collected through these
                technologies, please read our Privacy Policy.
              </p>
              <h5>What are cookies?</h5>
              <p>
                A cookie is a small text file that is transferred by a web
                server and stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile
                device when you visit certain websites. Generally, cookies are
                used to make your browsing experience better by allowing a
                website to remember your actions and preferences (for example,
                your authentication status). Cookies also provide information on
                how people may use a website (for instance, whether it’s their
                first time visiting or if they are a frequent visitor).
              </p>
              <h5>What cookies do we use and why?</h5>
              <p>
                We use a number of different cookies to provide you with our
                Services, to monitor usage and performance, to customize and
                improve your experience, and to facilitate our marketing, social
                and advertising activities.
              </p>
              <h5>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h5>
              <p>
                We use a small number of cookies that are necessary to allow you
                to use our Services. The use of these cookies is essential for
                our Services to work. For example, we use session cookies for
                the duration of a session to keep track of a user’s identity and
                authentication status.
              </p>
              <h5>Functional Cookies</h5>
              <p>
                We use third party tools to help customize our website and to
                remember choices you’ve made, some of which may use cookies or
                similar technology in order to function. For example, we use
                tools like Hello Bar and Proof to customize messaging for
                website visitors.
              </p>
              <h5>Analytics and Reporting Cookies</h5>
              <p>
                We use many tools to help us improve our Services and the
                overall user experience for our customers and website visitors.
                To this end, we use reporting and analytics cookies to collect
                information about how you use our website, and how often. For
                example, we use Google Analytics and other third-party analytics
                providers to help measure how users interact with our website
                content and product features. For more information on Google
                Analytics, visit Google’s information page.
              </p>
              <h5>Marketing and Advertising Cookies</h5>
              <p>
                We use a number of tools to help us with our marketing efforts,
                some of which may use cookies or similar technology. Marketing
                and advertising cookies are used on our marketing website to
                tailor marketing to you and your interests and provide you with
                a more personalized service in the future. These cookies
                remember that you visited our website and we may verify this
                information with third-parties, such as advertisers. Although
                these cookies can track your device’s visits to our website and
                other sites, they typically cannot personally identify you.
              </p>
              <h5>Social and Content Cookies</h5>
              <p>
                Social and content cookies are placed by many social media
                plugins (for example, the Facebook “like” button), and other
                tools meant to provide or improve the content on a website (for
                example, services that allow the playing of video files, or that
                create comments sections). We integrate some of these modules
                into our website to improve the experience of browsing and
                interacting with our content. Some of these third party services
                may place cookies that are also used for things like behavioral
                advertising, analytics, and/or market research.
              </p>
              <h5>How to opt-out, remove or prevent the setting of cookies</h5>
              <p>
                Most browsers give you the ability to manage cookies to suit
                your preferences. In some browsers you can set up rules to
                manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, giving you more
                fine-grained control over your privacy. This means you can
                disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust.<br /><br />
                To customize your cookie management preferences for your
                browser, please consult the documentation that your browser
                manufacturer provides. For display advertising, you may opt out
                at any time by visiting your Google Ads Settings page or by
                installing and running the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser
                Add-on. The Network Advertising Initiative has also developed a
                tool available here that may help you understand which third
                parties have currently enabled cookies for your browser and
                opt-out of those cookies. In addition, on your iPhone, iPad or
                Android, you can change your device settings to control whether
                you see online interest-based ads.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please keep in mind that removing or blocking cookies can
                negatively impact your user experience and parts of our website
                or Services may no longer be fully accessible.
