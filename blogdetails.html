            <p>
              IRS Form W-9, is one of many tax documents required by the IRS
              (Internal Revenue Service) to help contract workers accurately
              estimate the taxes owed in a given tax year. It is a common IRS
              form used to provide necessary information to a person or company
              making payments to another person or company. One of the most
              typical situations is working as an independent contractor for a
              business. Businesses use it to obtain tax data from outside
              sources.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Information about taxpayers is gathered using Form W-9 to assist
                with informational reporting to the IRS.
              </li>
              <li>
                Although it is used in other contexts as well, the Form W-9 is
                most frequently used when working with businesses that employ
                independent contractors.
              </li>
              <li>
                The form requests that a taxpayer enter their name, address, tax
                bracket, and withholding specifications.
              </li>
              <li>
                Due to the sensitivity of the information on Form W-9, all
                parties should exercise caution when obtaining, sending, and
                storing the document.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A W-9 form has two sections. The payee's identification
              information is in Part I. The certification, or signature, in Part
              II attests to the accuracy of the ID information. It is also known
              as a "request for taxpayer identification number and
              certification," though "W-9" is the more common name.

            <h2>Purpose of Form W-9</h2>
            <p>
              A W-9 is used to obtain tax information from a vendor, independent
              contractor, freelancer or gig worker. A business is required to
              file an information return when it pays a non-employee or another
              entity more than $600 for their services in a calendar year. The
              goal of a W-9 is to obtain all necessary information directly from
              the service provider in order to guarantee that the information
              returned is accurate. Even though some information is accessible
              to the general public, Form W-9 safeguards the company requesting
              the information by requiring the other party to sign the completed
              form. The signature attests that:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The provided tax identification number (TIN) is accurate.</li>
              <li>Backup withholding is not applicable to the other party.</li>
              <li>
                The opposing party asserts that they are exempt from backup
                withholding.
              </li>
              <li>
                The vendor's FATCA code (as well as their exemption status).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Businesses fill out that information return using the name,
              address, Social Security number, or tax identification number
              contractors provide on Form W-9. The IRS should not receive copies
              from either the sender or the recipient. The company requesting
              the tax information must also keep copies of the form in a secure
              location.
            </p>

            <!--  -->
            <h2>Uses of Form W-9</h2>
            <p>
              The IRS receives a variety of informational returns that are
              prepared using the Form W-9. The most typical scenario is when an
              independent contractor finishes work for a business and gets paid.
              The independent contractor must receive a Form 1099-MISC and
              self-report their taxes if they receive more than $600 in a
              calendar year. The intent behind a Form W-9 goes beyond this
              particular circumstance. In order to file Forms 1099-INT,
              1099-DIV, or 1099-B, a bank or financial institution depends on
              receiving taxpayer data. A Form W-9 may also be required from a
              taxpayer in the case of student loans, real estate transactions,
              and debt cancellation.
            </p>
            <!--  -->
            <h2>When to request a W9 Form</h2>
            <p>
              Form W-9 is required in order to conduct business with independent
              contractors and freelancers. You must obtain a W-9 for tax
              purposes if your business pays non-employees or small businesses
              more than $600 each for work that has been completed. Your company
              is exempt from paying Social Security and Medicare taxes, as well
              as deducting income taxes from payments made to independent
              contractors. As a result, the IRS needs to know to whom you are
              paying in order to be able to pursue collection. Use your W-9s to
              report how much you paid each contractor at the end of the year by
              keeping them safely stored.
            </p>
            <!--  -->
            <h2>Information needed on Form W-9</h2>
            <p>
              Independent contractors must provide the following pieces of
              information on Form W-9:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Name:</b>> This name will appear on the taxpayer's tax
                return. This field must be filled out. This field either
                contains the name of an individual or, in the case of a sole
                proprietor, the name of the owner. The name of a partnership or
                other entity may also be listed by the taxpayer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Other Business Name:</b> Only if the taxpayer uses a business
                name, trade name, DBA name, or disregarded entity name is this
                line necessary.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Federal Tax Classification: </b>The taxpayer must indicate
                their legal status as a corporation, an individual, a sole
                proprietor, an LLC with only one member, a limited liability
                company, a partnership, a trust, or an estate. The taxpayer is
                only required to choose one of the available options.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b></b>The taxpayer must decide if they are exempt from FATCA
                reporting or backup withholding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Address:</b> The taxpayer must enter their ZIP code, city,
                and state along with their address.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Account Numbers:</b> At the request of the requestor, the
                taxpayer may provide additional information in this option
                field. For illustration, a bank or brokerage company might
                request that the client enter their client information here.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Part I, Tax Identification Number:</b> The main goal of a W-9
                is to obtain the taxpayer's tax identification number. This
                could be an employee identification number or a social security
                number.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The taxpayer must sign the form under Part II after providing the
              aforementioned information (Certification). Form W-9 must be
              carefully guarded by the person filling it out and the business
              receiving the completed form during transmission and after receipt
              to prevent identity theft because it asks for a tax ID or social
              security number.
            </p>
            <!--  -->
            <h2>Penalties for Non-Compliant Form W-9</h2>
            <p>
              For failing to provide or adhere to the reporting requirements of
              Form W-9, the IRS has specified a number of penalties. For each
              instance of non-compliance with tax law and regulation, the
              taxpayer is liable for a $50 file if they fail to provide a valid
              tax number. If the taxpayer can demonstrate that the
              non-compliance was not the result of willful neglect, this fine
              may be waived. If a taxpayer provides inaccurate information that
              results in inaccurate withholding, they may also be subject to
              civil penalties. The taxpayer may be fined up to $500 if they
              knowingly provide false information that prevents backup
              withholding. Further non-compliance carries heavier penalties,
              including in some circumstances the possibility of criminal
              prosecution for the taxpayer. The taxpayer faces fines or jail
              time for willfully fabricating any declarations or information.
              The requester of taxpayer information is also subject to
              penalties. The requestor may face civil or criminal penalties if
              he or she discloses or uses the taxpayer's TINs in violation of
              federal law.
            </p>
            <!--  -->
            <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
            <p>
              If an independent contractor receives an unexpected W-9, he or she
              should pause before filling it out and investigate whether the
              requester has a legitimate reason for requesting this form. When
              financial institutions need to report dividends or interest, they
              may use Form W-9 to request information from customers. Be
              cautious: the financial institution should have your tax ID number
              from when you opened the account. Another situation in which you
              should be cautious before completing Form W-9 is if the company
              requesting it is your employer and you are supposed to be
              classified as an employee rather than an independent contractor.
            </p>
            <!--  -->
            <h2>What is backup withholding?</h2>
            <p>
              If the IRS has informed a contractor that they are subject to
              "backup withholding," the businesses paying the contractor's
              invoices must withhold and remit income tax at a flat rate of 24%
              from the invoice. If a contractor is subject to backup
              withholding, they must specify it on their W-9.
            </p>
            <!--  -->
            <h2>What is the Most Secure Way to Submit Form W-9?</h2>
            <p>
              It's best if you can deliver the document in person. Otherwise,
              you can use a free online service to encrypt your completed Form
              W-9 and securely email it to the requester. You could also use a
              file-sharing service that is encrypted. Another option is to send
              it via FedEx, UPS, or the postal service, though there is no
              guarantee that it will not be lost, stolen, or tampered with in
              transit. There's also no guarantee that the recipient will store
              the form securely even if you send it securely, so inquire about
              their storage method before sending.
            </p>
            <!--  -->
            <h2>Can I Refuse to Fill Out Form W-9?</h2>
            <p>
              If you refuse to comply with a legitimate request, your client
              will withhold 24% of your pay. The IRS requires businesses to
              obtain a completed Form W-9 from anyone they pay $600 or more to
              during the year. Fines may be imposed for failure to comply.
              However, if you believe the person requesting the form has no
              right to request it, refusing it is probably a good idea. If you
              are concerned, seek advice from a tax professional.

              <br /><br />
              W-9 forms are commonly used in a variety of situations, most
              notably for independent contractors or freelancers. It is critical
              that you fill out the form correctly because you may face
              penalties if you do not. All of the information, however, should
              be relatively easy to obtain. Take care to protect your sensitive
              information and accurate tax reporting status when distributing
              the form to the requesting party.
