              understood, and agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of
              this Agreement. If Customer is using the Services on behalf of an

              ARBITRATION NOTICE. Except for certain kinds of disputes described
              in the Arbitration provision below, Customer agrees that disputes

              or jury. See the Arbitration provision below.
            </p>
            <h2>1.Services</h2>
            <p>
              The Services consist of cloud-based financial tools and services
              which may include
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (i) bookkeeping, accounting data storage and processing
                services,
              </li>
              <li>(ii) financial information storage and reporting,</li>
              <li>
                (iii) tax preparation and support services (“Tax Services”),
              </li>
              <li>
                (iv) the service of communicating information to, from and among
                Third Party Servicers, as per Customer instructions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Customer may make certain selections of Services that they wish to
              procure through the Application or the Account.
              Ourbookkeepingservices will provide the Services to Customer for
              the term of this Agreement, subject to the payment of applicable
              Fees and compliance with the terms of this Agreement. As part of
              the Services, Ourbookkeepingservices hereby grants to Customer a
              non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable right to use the
              Services, as per the terms of this Agreement. Customer
              acknowledges that the Services are cloud-based and hosted services
              and no copies of the Services or Ourbookkeepingservices System
              will be delivered to Customer, other than (where available) the
              App, subject to the End User License Agreement (“EULA”). The
              Services shall be used by Customer solely for Customer own
              purposes and Ourbookkeepingservices does not convey any right,
              title or interest in the Services or Ourbookkeepingservices System
              to Customer. Customer right to use the Services shall terminate
              upon any termination of this Agreement or any suspension or
              termination of the supply of the Services to Customer.
            </p>
            <h5>Financial Transactions</h5>
            <p>
              Ourbookkeepingservices shall not perform any financial
              transactions for Customer. Customer may, however, be able to use
              the Services to communicate Customer instructions to a Third Party
              Servicer of Customer which Third Party Servicer may perform a
              financial transaction on behalf of Customer pursuant to the Third
              Party Servicer Agreement. Ourbookkeepingservices is not liable for
              any such financial transaction or the results thereof.
            </p>
            <h5>Errors</h5>
            <p>
              Customer shall immediately notify Ourbookkeepingservices of any
              errors by Ourbookkeepingservices or Customer in the supply or use
              of the Services. Where practicable, Ourbookkeepingservices shall
              use commercially reasonable efforts to investigate errors, but
              makes no representation as to its ability to correct the error.
              Customer shall provide Ourbookkeepingservices with any information
              necessary to investigate an error in a Transaction. Some payment
              transactions, such as wire transfers, are irreversible, so
              Customer agrees to exercise extreme caution when initiating any
              financial transaction by way of instructions delivered one of its
              Third Party Servicers through the Services.
            </p>
            <h5>Tax Services</h5>
            <p>
              Customer acknowledges that Ourbookkeepingservices will provide Tax
              Services only if and upon Customer’s completion of a validly
              executed Taxpayer Disclosure Authorization in which Customer
              consents to allow Ourbookkeepingservices to disclose certain tax
              information as specifically described therein for such period
              until Customer is no longer using Ourbookkeepingservices’s tax
              return preparation services. Customer understands and acknowledges
              that Ourbookkeepingservices will not provide Tax Services until
              such Taxpayer Disclosure Authorization is executed and provided to
              Ourbookkeepingservices.
            </p>
            <h2>2.Ourbookkeepingservices Account and Customer ID.</h2>
            <p>
              Ourbookkeepingservices shall provide Customer with a unique and
              private Account accessible through the Service. The Account shall
              be a record of Customer Transactions and Fees.
              Ourbookkeepingservices shall provide Customer with access codes
              for the Account. Customer shall not disclose such codes or permit
              any third party to use them. Customer has exclusive responsibility
              for the use of Customer Account. Ourbookkeepingservices will
              invite Customer to enter certain preferences and specifications
              within the Application or the Account that will apply to the
              Services; Customer assumes exclusive responsibility for such
              selections even if they contain errors by Customer or result in
              losses to Customer. Any additional terms and conditions posted to
              the Site with respect to the Account or specific Services
              preferences selected by Customer are incorporated herein by
              reference.
            </p>
            <p>
              Except as required to deliver the Services or as otherwise
              required by law, Ourbookkeepingservices shall not grant any third
              party access to Customer Account. Customer shall notify
              Ourbookkeepingservices by email to help@ourbookkeepingservices.com
              immediately of any loss or disclosure, whether voluntary or
              otherwise, of any Account password or access code to a third
              party.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon Customer’s request, Ourbookkeepingservices will also issue
              Customer a Customer ID associated with the Account (“Customer
              ID”). Customer may share their Customer ID only with officers,
              directors, bookkeepers, accountants or other Customer personnel
              that are directly employed or engaged by Customer (“Customer
              Personnel”) provided that Customer binds such third parties to
              undertakings of confidentiality and to also honor the terms
              hereof. Customer Personnel may only access and use the Services
              through the Customer ID and in compliance with this Agreement;
              Customer will not allow Customer Personnel to share the Customer
              ID with third parties. Customer is responsible for all activity
              occurring under its Customer ID whether by Customer Personnel or
              otherwise. Ourbookkeepingservices reserves the right to replace
              the Customer ID in its sole discretion for any reason or for no
              reason. Any Customer Personnel who accesses the Services does so
              subject to this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customer shall provide, at Customer’s own expense, all necessary
              hardware, applications and internet connectivity necessary to
              access the Services. Customer acknowledges that the internet can
              be unpredictable in performance, unsecure and may, from time to
              time, impede access to the Services or performance hereunder.
              Customer agrees that Ourbookkeepingservices is not responsible for
              any internet outages, unsecure WIFI or other connections or any
              other interference with Customer’s use of or access to the
              Services or security breaches arising from any Customer Device and
              Customer waives any and all claims against Ourbookkeepingservices
              in connection therewith.

              consents for Ourbookkeepingservices to collect, process, store
              such data hereunder from the relevant data subjects. Data
              collected by Ourbookkeepingservices is subject to the
              Ourbookkeepingservices Privacy Policy, posted at the Site and
              incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Law, where
              Ourbookkeepingservices is subject to a subpoena request for
              Customer Data, Ourbookkeepingservices shall provide Customer with
              an opportunity to contest the request, failing which
              Ourbookkeepingservices shall cooperate with the request.
            </p>
            <p>
              Subject to any separate agreement between Customer and
              Ourbookkeepingservices, Customer hereby authorizes
              Ourbookkeepingservices and each Third Party Servicer to each
              obtain from the others and disclose to the others Customer Data in
              so far as is necessary to supply their respective services either
              hereunder or under their respective Third Party Servicer
              Agreements. Where required by Law, Ourbookkeepingservices will
              disclose Customer Data to law enforcement agencies.
              Ourbookkeepingservices reserves the right to keep Customer Data
              for the term of this Agreement and for five (5) years thereafter.

            <h2>6.Customer Data.</h2>
            <h5>Accuracy</h5>
            <p>
              Customer has sole responsibility for the accuracy, appropriateness
              and completeness of all Customer Data. Ourbookkeepingservices will
              use the Customer Data it is provided in performing the Services
              and is not responsible for reviewing, validating or otherwise
              confirming the accuracy, appropriateness or completeness of
              Customer Data.
            </p>
            <h5>Security</h5>
            <p>
              Ourbookkeepingservices will take reasonable steps to help protect
              Customer Data. However, Customer understands and agrees that such
              steps do not guarantee that the Services are invulnerable to all
              security breaches or immune from viruses, security threats or
              other vulnerabilities. Ourbookkeepingservices reserves the right
              to cooperate with local, state and federal authorities in
              investigations of improper or unlawful activities and this may
              require the disclosure of Customer’s personal information.
              Ourbookkeepingservices may also report to other organizations
              about improper or unlawful user activities and this reporting may
              include disclosure of personal information relating to those
              individuals conducting such improper or unlawful activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customer shall secure Customer Data in its possession or under its
              control. Customer assumes exclusive responsibility for ensuring
              the security of Customer Device and the Data on it.
              Ourbookkeepingservices is not liable for the operation or failure
              of Customer Devices or those of any third party, including but not
              limited to processors, hosting services, internet service
              providers and other Third Party Servicers. Customer shall not
              operate Customer Device in a manner that does not meet the
              applicable security requirements of Ourbookkeepingservices,
              indicated in the Account or on the Site, or those of Third Party
              Servicers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ourbookkeepingservices is not responsible for performing, and is
              not liable for any failure to perform, any back-up of any Customer
              Data or other data provided, transmitted, processed, or stored by
              Customer in or through the Services. It is Customer’s
              responsibility to back-up onto a Customer Device all Customer
              Data, including all data and records that Customer submits to
              Ourbookkeepingservices.
            </p>
            <h5>Sharing</h5>
            <p>
              Ourbookkeepingservices shall disclose Customer Data to those
              representatives of Customer identified by Customer for such
              purposes and also to such Third Party Servicers as Customer has
              selected. Ourbookkeepingservices has no liability for any
              collection, processing, storage, use or disclosure of Customer
              Data by any Third Party Servicer or any other third party.
              Ourbookkeepingservices reserves the right to decline to share
              Customer Data with any third party where Ourbookkeepingservices
              believes that such sharing may expose Customer or
              Ourbookkeepingservices to excessive security, financial or
              reputational risk, provided however that Ourbookkeepingservices
              shall never be liable for any act or omission of any third party
              with respect to Customer Data or otherwise. Ourbookkeepingservices
              makes no warranty, representation, endorsement, or guarantee
              regarding, and accepts no responsibility or liability for, the
              quality, content, nature, veracity or reliability of any Customer
              Data.
            </p>
            <h5>Feedback</h5>
            <p>
              In the event that Customer provides Ourbookkeepingservices any
              ideas, thoughts, criticisms, suggested improvements or other
              feedback related to the Services (collectively “Feedback”),
              Customer agrees that Ourbookkeepingservices may use the Feedback
              to modify the Services and that Customer will not be due any
              compensation, including any royalty related to the product or
              service that incorporates the Feedback. Customer hereby grants
              Ourbookkeepingservices a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid,
              perpetual, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify,
              translate, distribute, perform, display, import, sell, offer for
              sale, make, have made and otherwise exploit the Feedback in any
              form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter
              developed, and to allow others to do the same. This is true
              whether Customer provides the Feedback on the Services or through
              any other method of communication with Ourbookkeepingservices.
            </p>
            <h5>Limitations</h5>
            <p>
              Customer shall not take possession of or enter into the Account
              any data: (i) that Customer does not have the lawful right to
              copy, transmit, distribute, and display (including any Customer
              Data that would violate any confidentiality or fiduciary
              obligations that Customer might have with respect to the Customer
              Data); (ii) for which Customer does not have the consent or
              permission from the owner of any personally identifiable
              information contained in the Customer Data; (iii) that infringes,
              misappropriates or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property
              Rights or violates any privacy rights of any third party; (iv)
              that is false or misleading; (v) that is defamatory, obscene, or
              offensive; (vi) that violates, or encourages any conduct that
              would violate, any Laws or regulation or would give rise to civil
              or criminal liability; or (vii) that contains any viruses, trojan
              horses, spyware, malware, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, or other
              disabling devices or other harmful component intended to damage,
              detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or
              expropriate any system, data or personal information.
            </p>
            <h5>Financial Data Storage, Not Advice</h5>
            <p>
              The Services enable the storage of Customer Data that is of a
              financial nature (e.g., bookkeeping, accounting and other
              financial information). Customer acknowledges, however, that the
              Services (other than the tax preparation and advisory services) do
              not include the supply of any accounting, financial, investment,
              legal or other professional advice. Ourbookkeepingservices is not
              an accounting or other professional services firm.
              Ourbookkeepingservices does not hold any licenses for the supply
              of any accounting, financial, investment, legal or other
              professional advice, and none of the Services shall be construed
              as including any such services. Data presented in the Services,
              such as financial information, for example, shall not be construed
              as reflective of the financial status of Customer or any third
              party nor are they necessarily compatible with any specific
              accounting standards, such as GAAP (generally accepted accounting
              principles). Customer shall be exclusively responsible for
              retaining third party any accounting, financial, investment, legal
              and other professional advice.
            </p>
            <h5>Customer Call Monitoring</h5>
            <p>
              Ourbookkeepingservices may monitor and record support-related and
              other outbound calls to Customer, as well as inbound calls to
              Ourbookkeepingservices by Customer or Customer’s representatives,
              for compliance, support, training and other purposes. Customer
              agrees that Ourbookkeepingservices may record any call between
              Customer and Ourbookkeepingservices relating to the Services, and
              agrees to (i) notify all relevant Customer employees that calls
              with Ourbookkeepingservices may be monitored and (ii) indemnify
              and hold harmless Ourbookkeepingservices from any claim arising as
              a result of Ourbookkeepingservices monitoring or recording of
              calls between Ourbookkeepingservices and Customer’s
              representatives.
            </p>
            <h2>7.Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              Customer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless
              Ourbookkeepingservices, its employees, officers, directors
              Affiliates, suppliers, licensors, Third Party Servicers and other
              customers against any and all liability including damages,
              recoveries, deficiencies, interest, penalties, losses and
              reasonable attorney’s fees arising out of or relating to: (i) any
              breach of the terms hereof; (ii) any breach of a Third Party
              Servicer Agreement; (iii) any violation of any Laws; (iv) any use
              of Customer Data by Customer or a Third Party Servicer or other
              third party; (v) Customer use of the Services, including in
              combination with any third party service; (vi) any Transaction;
              (vii) any financial transaction occurring as a result of data
              communicated via the Services; (viii) any act or omission of any
              Third Party Servicer or Client; (ix) costs incurred by
              Ourbookkeepingservices enforcing the terms hereof or responding to
              any subpoena relating to Customer, Customer Data or a Third Party
              Servicer; (x) any claim by a governmental taxing authority; or
              (xi) any dispute between Customer and any third party or Customer

            </p>
            <h2>8.Term, Termination and Suspension</h2>
            <h5>Term</h5>
            <p>
              The term of this Agreement shall begin as of when Customer accepts
              this Agreement, completes the Application or obtains an Account,
              shall continue in effect for an initial period of either one month
              or one year, depending on Customer’s selection at account
              activation (the “Initial Term”), and shall automatically renew for
              a period of the same duration as the Initial Term upon the
              expiration of the Initial Term or any subsequent term (each, a
              “Renewal Term” and, together with the Initial Term, the “Term”)
              unless either party provides the other with advanced written
              notice of its election not to renew this Agreement before the
              expiration of the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as
              applicable.
            </p>
            <h5>Termination</h5>
            <p>
              Customer may cease using the Services by closing their Account or
              such other means as the Services may provide, but doing so does
              not act to terminate this Agreement. Customer must provide
              Ourbookkeepingservices with written notice in accordance with the
              immediately preceding paragraph that Customer elects not to renew
              this Agreement when the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term
              expires. Customer will be responsible for any Fees due during the
              remainder of the Term. Ourbookkeepingservices may terminate this
              Agreement by notice to Customer through the Account, by email to
              the contact information provided in the Application or by other
              electronic notice to other contact information provided by
              Customer to Ourbookkeepingservices.
            </p>
            <h5>Suspension</h5>
            <p>
              Ourbookkeepingservices may, at its discretion, suspend Customer
              access to, or otherwise modify, the Services and any component
              thereof, without notice in order to: (i) prevent damages to, or
              degradation of the integrity of, Ourbookkeepingservices’s internet
              network; (ii) comply with any Law; (iii) otherwise protect
              Ourbookkeepingservices from potential legal liability or harm to
              its reputation or business; or (iv) because Ourbookkeepingservices
              has opted to change the Services. Ourbookkeepingservices will use
              commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer of the
              reason(s) for such suspension or termination action as soon as
              reasonably practicable. Nothing contained in this Agreement will
              be construed to limit Ourbookkeepingservices’s actions or remedies
              or act as a waiver of Ourbookkeepingservices’s rights in any way
              with respect to any of the foregoing activities.
              Ourbookkeepingservices will not be responsible for any loss or
              damages incurred by Customer as a result of any termination or
              suspension of access to or use of the Services.
            </p>
            <h2>9.Customer Support</h2>
            <p>
              Ourbookkeepingservices will use commercially reasonable efforts to
              provide Customer with technical support services relating to the
              Services via its technical support website, email, or telephone.
              Ourbookkeepingservices may update the Services in its sole
              discretion which updates may alter, add or remove functionality of
              the Services. Ourbookkeepingservices may also, from time to time,
              schedule downtime for maintenance and upgrades to the Services.
            </p>
            <h2>10. Fees</h2>
            <h5>Fees</h5>
            <p>
              Access to the Services may require Customer to pay Fees, as may be
              further described at
              <a href="https://ourbookkeepingservices.com/pricing"
                >https://ourbookkeepingservices.com/pricing/</a
              >
              or otherwise on the Site, the App or in the Account. All Fees are
              in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable, unless otherwise provided
              herein. Ourbookkeepingservices reserves the right to amend the
              Fees by posting new Fees on the Site, in the App or in the
              Account; such changes shall take effect within thirty (30) days
              unless accepted by Customer earlier or if Customer does not close
              their Account within such delay.
            </p>
            <h5>Payment</h5>
            <p>
              Customer shall authorize Ourbookkeepingservices to collect payment
              of Fees from a credit card, debit card or other means of payment;
              Customer authorizes Ourbookkeepingservices to charge all Fees and
              other amounts owing hereunder, including all applicable taxes,
              from such payment method. If Customer pays any Fees with a credit
              card, Ourbookkeepingservices may seek pre-authorization of
              Customer’s credit card account prior to Customer’s purchase to
              verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds
              or credit available to cover Customer’s purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Services may include functionality for activating, updating,
              or canceling recurring payments for periodic charges. If Customer
              activates or updates recurring payments through the Services,
              Customer authorizes Ourbookkeepingservices to periodically charge,
              on a going-forward basis and until expiration or termination of
              the Term, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for
              the accrued sums. Customer must provide Ourbookkeepingservices
              with written notice of its election not to renew the Term before
              it renews to avoid billing and payment for the next recurring
              Renewal Term. For example, if Customer has a one-year long Initial
              Term and a subscription plan providing for 12 monthly payments
              during the Initial Term, (a) if Customer provides
              Ourbookkeepingservices with written notice of its election not to
              renew this Agreement before the expiration of the Initial Term,
              Customer will be responsible for any remaining monthly payments
              during the Initial Term but not for any subsequent Renewal Term,
              however, (b) if Customer fails to provide Ourbookkeepingservices
              with written notice of its election not to renew this Agreement
              before the end of the Initial Term, this Agreement will renew for
              another year and Customer will be responsible to pay the 12
              monthly payments during the Renewal Term. If Customer updates or
              cancels any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it
              may take up to 10 business days for the update or cancellation to
              take effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without limitation, Ourbookkeepingservices reserves the right to
              suspend the Services until all Fees or other amounts owing
              hereunder are paid in full or terminate this Agreement for late
              payment. Fees quoted do not include, and Customer shall pay and
              hold Ourbookkeepingservices harmless from all sales, use, gross
              receipts, value-added, personal property or other taxes, and all
              applicable duties, tariffs, assessments, export and import fees or
              similar charges (including interest and penalties imposed thereon)
              on the transaction contemplated herein, other than taxes based on
              the net income or profits of Ourbookkeepingservices.
            </p>
            <h5>ACH Consent</h5>
            <p>
              Customer desires to effect settlement of credits and debits from
              Customer Bank Account(s) by means of ACH and/or wire transfer in
              conjunction with the Services for Customer by
              Ourbookkeepingservices. In accordance with this desire, Customer
              authorizes Ourbookkeepingservices and/or its affiliates to
              initiate debit and credit entries to Customer Bank Account (the
              details of which are provided by Customer through the Account or
              by other means acceptable to Ourbookkeepingservices). Customer
              shall maintain sufficient funds in Customer Bank Account to cover
              such debit transactions. Customer states that Customer has the
              authority to agree to such transactions and that Customer Bank
              Account indicated is a valid and legitimate account for the
              handling of these transactions. This authority is to remain in
              effect until Ourbookkeepingservices receives written notice from
              Customer revoking it. This authorization is for the payment of
              Fees or any other sums owed to Ourbookkeepingservices. Customer
              certifies that the appropriate authorizations are in place to
              allow Customer to authorize this method of settlement. All changes
              to the identification of Customer Bank Account under this
              authorization must be made in writing in accordance with the
              Agreement. Customer understands that if the information
            </p>
            <p>
              supplied as to the ABA Routing Number and Account Number of the
              Customer Bank Account is incorrect, and funds are incorrectly
              deposited, Ourbookkeepingservices will attempt to assist Customer
              in the recovery of such funds but has no liability as to
              restitution of the same. Ourbookkeepingservices’s assistance in
              recovering the funds, where available, will be billed to Customer
              at Ourbookkeepingservices’s current hourly rate for such work.
              Customer acknowledges that the origination of ACH transactions to
              the Customer Bank Account must comply with the provisions of U.S.
              law.
