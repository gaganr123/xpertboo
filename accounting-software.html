            <h2 class="mb-3">Drawback of old Technique</h2>
            <p>
              Old book keeping technique has a lot of drawbacks, as it is fully
              manual and humans are more prone to make errors with doing each
              and every task manually. Common accounting and book keeping
              drawbacks due to old book keeping technique includes:
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style: square">
              <li>
                <p>
                  Old cloud-based accounting technique has a lot of drawbacks,
                  as it is fully manual. Manual accounting processes are
                  time-consuming and prone to mistakes, which can lead to
                  incorrect reports and financial losses.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Old bookkeeping techniques lack the advanced functionality
                  that modern methods offer, making it difficult to track,
                  analyze and report financial information accurately and
                  quickly.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Another major drawback of older cloud-based accounting
                  techniques is the cost associated with them. The storage
                  costs, fees, and other associated costs can add up quickly,
                  making it expensive to maintain an accounting system on the
                  cloud.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Drawbacks:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Not reconciled bank statements.</li>
              <li>Allowed tax deductions may be overlooked.</li>
              <li>
                Filing deadlines are missed because of incomplete books of
                account.
              </li>
              <li>Wasting a lot more time in bookkeeping than you need to.</li>
              <li>Expenses are not categorized correctly.</li>
              <li>
                Unmanaged record-keeping processes like putting all bills and
                receipts in one place.
              </li>
